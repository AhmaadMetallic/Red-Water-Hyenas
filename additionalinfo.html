    <h1 class="fs-5">I know what you're thinking...</h1>
    <br>

    <div class="p fs-4">Why do I have to get a flu shot? I <strong class="fs-4">hate</strong> needles!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">Ever hear of a little thing called history? Well, it turns out that 100 years ago (literally back in 1918), there was not one but two flu pandemics! </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">  It wiped out up to 500 Million people. That was roughly 5% of the world's population!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">Doctors were overwhelmed with sick populations, and they didn't know how to stop it.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">No public health institution was prepared for something of this magnitude.</div> 
    <br>
    <div class="p">They tried everything from gargling disinfectants, wearing masks, using leeches, blood letting, improving sterilization methods, suspending social events like church, concerts and even school! </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">The science of identifying viruses and developing vaccines were in their nascent years. However, the large population of sick patients provided a rich resource for scientists and doctors to sample.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">After some trial and error studies, the scientists were able to create a crude vaccine. Basically, they found some really sick people, took some fluid samples from their sputum, lungs, mucus and blood, filtered it out to obtain the virus, and then put it into someone that wasn't sick, yet. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">So, yeah...<em><strong>thankfully</strong></em>, we've come a long way from <em><strong>that</strong></em> solution!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">Scientists and doctors still haven't fully figured out everything there is to know about the flu. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">For example, the reason you have to get a flu shot every year - instead of once in your life - is because the virus changes every year. Sometimes the flu virus changes multiple times in one year! </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">There are some encouraging signs that scientists are getting closer to finding "the one" flu vaccine. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">Until then, you should go ahead and get it. Well, that is, so long as it's what a doctor believes is a healthy choice for you (pssst...we're not doctors). </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">If you've never had the flu shot before or haven't spoken to your doctor about it, here are some important notes you should consider before talking to a medical professional.</div>
    <br>

    <div class="container">
      <h3><strong>Who shouldn’t get a flu shot?</strong></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Children younger than 6 months are too young to get a flu shot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>People with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. </li>
      </ul> 
    </div>

    <h3><strong>Ask your doctor before you get a flu shot:</strong></h3>
    <div class="container">
      <ul>
        <li>If you have an allergy to eggs or any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Talk to your doctor about your allergy.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If you ever had Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a severe paralyzing illness, also called GBS). Some people with a history of GBS should not get this vaccine. Talk to your doctor about your GBS history.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If you are not feeling well, talk to your doctor about your symptoms.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="p">One last thing...It is IMPOSSIBLE to get the flu from the flu shot!</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">Unless you plan on going back to 1918, to let some guy that says he's a scientist put some other guys contaminated blood in you, the flu vaccine won't make you sick.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">That being said, the vaccine won't necessarily prevent you from getting sick either. Look, it's complicated. There are some videos and other resources on this page you can view for additional information. </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">In a nutshell, no one wants a repeat of 1918 and no one wants to lose their kids or grandparents to a preventable illness.</div> 
    <br>
    <div class="p">Don't you agree?</div>
    <div class="p">
    <strong> Then help us spread the word!</strong>
    <br>
    Share a link to this app! Get vaccinated! Ask your friends if they got their flu shot! </</div>
    <br>
    
    <h4><strong>
      Don't wait! Spread the word - not the virus - today!

    <h5><strong>Flu Fighters</strong></h5>

    <div class="p">Is an app to assist with reducing the time from start of flu season to vaccination.

      By leveraging available APIs from pharmacies and medical providers, we reduce the time between threat level awareness and vaccination.

      Research continues by institutions such as the CDC, Harvard University, and Google to establish a reliable flu forecasting model. As one does not exist today and the field is highly complex, we have opted for a novel way to focus on raising awareness and prevention in communities. 

    This project was the result of the collaborative efforts of Nitesh Bhatia, Jimin Yeom, Jermain Foster, Priscila Deavila and Trevor Sheffield, in accordance with the requirements of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, powered by Trilogy Education Services, at Georgia Tech Professional Education, at Georgia Institute of Technology.</div>
